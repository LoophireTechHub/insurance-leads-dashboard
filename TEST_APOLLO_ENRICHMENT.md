# ✅ Apollo.io Paid Account - Enrichment Improvements

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Problem:**
Apollo was matching to WRONG organizations:
- "NIP Group" (NJ) → Matched to random "NIP" companies globally
- "Rocket" (Detroit) → Matched to wrong Rocket company
- All leads showed same 3 contacts: Mike Braham, Bill Gates, J Montes

### **Solution:**
Improved organization matching algorithm:

1. **Search multiple organizations** (up to 5 instead of just 1)
2. **Verify name match** - Company name must closely match org name
3. **Check US location** - Prefer companies with .com domains or US country
4. **Match location** - Prioritize orgs in the same state as job location
5. **Select best match** - Choose most relevant organization

## 🔄 How to Test

### **Run Fresh Pipeline:**
```bash
export APOLLO_API_TOKEN=QbMb8hbOIHEpl_TVn1kSLg
python3 insurance_leads_pipeline_final.py
```

### **What You'll See in Logs:**
```
Enriching: NIP Group (Woodbridge, NJ, US)
  ✓ Matched: NIP Group | Woodbridge, NJ
  ✓ Found 3 contacts

Enriching: Liberty Mutual Insurance (Minneapolis, MN, US)
  ✓ Matched: Liberty Mutual Insurance | Boston, MA
  ✓ Found 3 contacts
```

### **Expected Results:**
- **Unique contacts per company** - No more duplicate names
- **Real leadership emails** - Actual executive emails (paid API benefit)
- **Accurate titles** - VP of Sales, CFO, CEO, etc.
- **Location verified** - Matches job location

## 📊 Dashboard Will Show

**Instead of:**
- ❌ Mike Braham (every company)
- ❌ email_not_unlocked@domain.com

**You'll See:**
- ✅ John Smith - VP of Sales
- ✅ ✉️ john.smith@nipgroup.com
- ✅ Sarah Johnson - Chief Financial Officer
- ✅ ✉️ sarah.j@libertymutual.com

## 🔍 Verification

After running pipeline, check:
```bash
# View first 5 leads with contacts
cat docs/data.json | grep -A 3 "Leadership 1 Name" | head -20
```

Should show **different names** for each company!
